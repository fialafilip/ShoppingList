# Shopping List Application Development Communication

## Introduction and Basic Structure
- We started by creating a mobile Shopping List application in React
- We implemented a Node.js backend with MongoDB
- We added Google login
- We created components for managing stores and shopping items

## Frontend Features
- List of stores with icons
- Drag and drop for list items
- Support for quantity and units of items
- Real-time updates between users
- PWA functionality for mobile installation
- Push notifications for changes

## Backend Features
- REST API for CRUD operations
- Google OAuth authentication
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- MongoDB database
- Push notifications via web-push

## Architecture
### Frontend Structure:
- App.jsx - main component with authentication
- ShopList.jsx - list of stores
- ShopItems.jsx - items in a store
- FamilyManager.jsx - family management
- Login.jsx - login screen

### Backend Structure:
- Shop Model - data about stores and items
- User Model - user data
- Family Model - families and their members
- Socket.io communication - real-time updates
- Web-push API - change notifications

## Challenges and Solved Problems
1. Implementation of Google OAuth authentication
2. Managing CORS and cookies for secure API calls
3. Real-time communication between clients
4. Drag and drop functionality for item ordering
5. Improving the user interface for both desktop and mobile
6. Implementation of Push notifications
7. Offline support via PWA

## Current Status and Next Steps
- Item list functionality is implemented
- Real-time updates work between clients
- PWA is ready for offline use
- Push notifications are set up and tested
- Optimization for different devices

## Future Improvements
- Improving UX for family management and sharing
- Adding shopping data analysis
- Integration with other services
- Extended notification options
- Data export/import capability

## Technologies Used
- React
- TailwindCSS
- React Query
- Node.js and Express
- MongoDB
- Socket.io
- Web-push
- Google OAuth

This overview summarizes our work so far on the Shopping List project, which now supports real-time collaboration between family members and modern features such as PWA and push notifications.
